# PROGRESS.md

Handover document. Update at the end of every working session.
Keep it short — this file is pasted into every new chat.

## Current state

**Phase**: 3 — client policy, sender rewriting and recipient routing
implemented, nothing yet compiled or run.
**Last session**: 2026-08-08 — recipient and source-network routing, per-route
message splitting in the spool, sender rewriting, global message size ceiling.
**Next action**: `gofmt -w . && go vet ./... && go test ./...` — phases 1, 2 and
3 were all written without a Go toolchain available, so this is the first
compile. Then end to end against the real tenant: `smtprelayd check`, a message
through the m365 route, a message with recipients in two routes to confirm the
split, and one deliberate wrong secret to confirm the queue defers.

## Phases

### Phase 0 — Scaffolding ✅

### Phase 1 — Minimum viable relay ✅ (untested against a live smarthost)

- [x] `internal/config`: TOML schema, strict decoding, CIDR overlap detection,
      fail-closed checks per `docs/SECURITY.md` section 2, `Secret` type that
      refuses literal values and cannot be formatted into a log line
- [x] `internal/spool`: durable queue, atomic rename, crash recovery,
      validated `ID` type with a private constructor
- [x] `internal/listener`: ports and TLS modes from configuration, STARTTLS,
      implicit TLS, client matching by CIDR, size and recipient limits,
      per-client rate and connection limits
- [x] `internal/delivery`: worker pool, per-route concurrency, retry schedule,
      4xx versus 5xx classification
- [x] `internal/delivery/smarthost`: SMTP client with SASL PLAIN and LOGIN,
      mandatory certificate verification, optional `ca_pin`
- [x] `internal/logging`: `slog` JSON output with central secret redaction
- [x] Address and line-length validation, CRLF and NUL rejection, hop counting
- [x] `smtprelayd selftest`: active open-relay check, wired into CI
- [x] Startup trust checks: config file, binary directory and data directory
      ownership and permissions, symlink refusal (abort, not warn)
- [x] `O_NOFOLLOW` and `O_EXCL` on spool writes
- [x] Per-connection `recover`, streaming size enforcement, header limits
- [x] Runs in the foreground on both platforms
- [ ] Windows ACL verification at startup (deferred to phase 5 with the
      installer; needs `golang.org/x/sys/windows`)
- [ ] MIME nesting depth bound (no MIME parsing exists yet; the header limits
      cover the current surface)

### Phase 2 — Microsoft 365 ✅ (untested against a live tenant)

- [x] `internal/authms365`: client credentials flow, in-memory token cache,
      refresh five minutes before expiry, cooldown after a rejected request,
      redirects refused, fixed authority, tenant validated before it reaches
      the URL
- [x] XOAUTH2 in the smarthost client, including the 334 failure path: the
      continuation is answered with an empty response and the decoded JSON
      error is carried into the log line
- [x] Authentication failures are retryable regardless of the SMTP code
- [x] Per-route rate limiting enforced in `internal/delivery` before a worker
      slot is taken; a paced message is deferred without consuming an attempt
- [x] OAuth2 configuration validation: tenant character set, ASCII mailbox,
      resource scope, `secret_expires` format, scope defaulting
- [x] Startup warning when the client secret expires within thirty days
- [ ] `docs/MS365-AUTH.md` verified against a real tenant
- [ ] Sovereign cloud authorities (`login.microsoftonline.us`, China) — needs a
      schema decision, deliberately not configurable today

### Phase 3 — Client policy and rewriting ✅ (uncompiled)

- [x] `internal/rewrite`: modes `off`, `if_unauthorized`, `force`, compiled per
      client at startup so a bad policy fails the service, not a message
- [x] Envelope and header rewriting, `Reply-To` disposition
      (`preserve`/`drop`/`fixed:`), `X-Original-From`, `header_from = "keep"`
      for a sender that is already aligned
- [x] Header block replaced structurally, never by concatenation; a message
      with two `From` headers or a control character in the preserved value is
      rejected with 550 rather than sanitised
- [x] `internal/router`: recipient domain, then source network, then the
      client route, then the default route; a source network competes with the
      client CIDR on prefix length
- [x] `route.sources` added to the schema; two routes claiming the same
      network or domain is a startup error
- [x] Recipients spanning several routes are split into one queue entry per
      route: `spool.Stage` writes the body once, `spool.Commit` makes one copy
      per route with its own `Received` header, and a failure halfway through
      withdraws the copies already made
- [x] `limits.max_message_mb` is the global ceiling; a client may lower it but
      the loader refuses a client value above it
- [x] `Envelope.OriginalFrom` records the pre-rewrite sender for the bounce
      records of phase 4
- [ ] Per-client rate limiting in the listener and the route-level pacing from
      phase 2 remain separate and both apply; no decision needed, recorded so
      it is not rediscovered

### Phase 4 — Observability ⬜

Unchanged.

### Phase 5 — Productionisation ⬜

Unchanged, plus:

- [ ] Log rotation (`[log] max_size_mb` and friends are parsed but the logger
      only appends; rotation needs a dependency decision)

## Open questions

- Tenant, mailbox and sending domain for the Microsoft 365 route.
- Should a failed token acquisition at startup abort, or only be logged? Today
  no token is fetched before the first delivery, so a tenant outage at boot is
  invisible until a message arrives.
- Should the dashboard require authentication, or is localhost binding enough?
- Which addresses go into `[bounce].notify`?
- Should downstream bounces be ingested from the relay mailbox via Graph?
- Should the API listener be exposed beyond localhost?
- A Postfix `main.cf` importer (`smtprelayd import-postfix`) was raised as a
  migration path. Scoped as a one-shot converter with an explicit report of
  what could not be translated, never a runtime parser. Not yet planned into a
  phase.
- Log rotation: accept `lumberjack` as a second dependency, or rotate
  externally with `logrotate` and the Windows equivalent?

## Decision log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-07 | Go instead of Rust | Direct MX delivery dropped, so no DNSSEC-validating resolver is needed |
| 2026-08-07 | Smarthost only, no direct MX | The smarthost owns reputation and bounce handling |
| 2026-08-07 | `modernc.org/sqlite` | Pure Go, keeps Windows cross-compilation trivial |
| 2026-08-07 | htmx instead of a JS framework | No Node build step |
| 2026-08-07 | Bounces are store records, not just log lines | Must be queryable and correlatable to a queue ID |
| 2026-08-07 | Bounce notification is optional and batched | An unbatched notifier turns one device into a second outage |
| 2026-08-07 | Static bearer tokens with read/admin scopes | Separates Checkmk polling from destructive actions |
| 2026-08-07 | API tokens stored as SHA-256 digests | A stolen configuration file must not yield usable credentials |
| 2026-08-07 | No `insecure_skip_verify` field in the schema | Such an option is always found enabled in production |
| 2026-08-07 | Empty client allowlist is a startup error | Open relay is the one failure that cannot be recovered from cheaply |
| 2026-08-07 | Startup aborts on a writable config, binary or data directory | Each converts a local user into control of a privileged process |
| 2026-08-07 | No auto-update mechanism | A privileged self-updating writer is a classic escalation surface |
| 2026-08-07 | `unsafe`, `os/exec`, `plugin` and cgo banned by CI import test | Removes categories rather than defending against them |
| 2026-08-07 | `github.com/BurntSushi/toml` as the only runtime dependency | Pure Go, no cgo, strict decoding via `Undecoded()` so a typo cannot silently become a default |
| 2026-08-07 | Strict decoding: an unknown key aborts startup | A misspelled `require_tls` that is silently ignored is indistinguishable from a disabled one |
| 2026-08-07 | Outbound `tls = "none"` removed from the schema | A smarthost without TLS is a deployment defect, not a supported mode |
| 2026-08-07 | A data-phase error closes the connection | Abandoning the stream desynchronises the command channel; continuing would risk misattributing the next command |
| 2026-08-07 | Permanent failures move to `spool/failed`, not deleted | Phase 5 turns them into DSNs; until then nothing is lost silently |
| 2026-08-07 | `InsecureSkipVerify` ban scoped to client and smarthost paths | The selftest probe pins its own listener certificate; a blanket grep would have forced a worse design |
| 2026-08-07 | Release provenance and SBOM in CI, no third-party release action | `gh` and the official attestation action keep the release path's own dependency set minimal |
| 2026-08-08 | Authentication failures are always temporary, never permanent | A 535 describes the relay's credentials, not the message; classifying it as permanent would move the whole queue to `spool/failed` when a secret is rotated |
| 2026-08-08 | Token authority is a constant, not a configuration field | The client secret is in the request body, so a configurable host is a place to send it elsewhere; sovereign clouds are a separate decision |
| 2026-08-08 | Redirects from the token endpoint are refused | Following one repeats the POST body, and with it the secret, to whatever host the response names |
| 2026-08-08 | A rejected token request is cached for 30 seconds | Otherwise an expired secret turns every queued message into another request and earns a tenant-level block |
| 2026-08-08 | Route pacing defers in the spool instead of blocking a worker | A blocked worker holds its route's concurrency budget and stalls dispatch for every other route |
| 2026-08-08 | Pacing does not increment the attempt counter | The message was never offered to the smarthost, so pacing must not consume its retry budget or bring its expiry forward |
| 2026-08-08 | `authms365.New` takes resolved strings, not `config.OAuth2` | Keeps the secret dereferencing in one place and makes the package testable without a configuration file |
| 2026-08-08 | Recipient domain outranks the client's route | A domain belongs to a destination, not to the device that happened to send to it; the loader refuses a domain claimed twice so the precedence can never be ambiguous |
| 2026-08-08 | Source networks live on the route (`route.sources`), not as a second client concept | A network can be pointed at a route without defining a client per device, and the client allowlist stays the only thing that decides whether a source may relay at all |
| 2026-08-08 | A source network competes with the client CIDR on prefix length | Otherwise a site-wide rule would silently override a per-device one, or vice versa, depending on which was checked first |
| 2026-08-08 | Mixed-route recipients are split into one queue entry per route | A legacy device handed a 5xx for a mixed recipient list has no way to recover, and refusing the whole message would lose the recipients that were routable |
| 2026-08-08 | A message that cannot be rewritten safely is rejected with 550 | Two `From` headers or a control character in a preserved value means guessing at what the client meant; guessing is how a header gets split |
| 2026-08-08 | `header_from = "keep"` only survives while aligned with the new envelope sender | SPF checks the envelope and DMARC the header, so an unaligned pair produces a message the smarthost rejects |
| 2026-08-08 | A client may lower `max_message_mb` but never raise it | A per-client limit that can exceed the global one is not a limit |
| 2026-08-08 | Licensed GPL-3.0-or-later, copyright Tokajer | Chosen over AGPL because the relay is meant to be run inside customer infrastructure without the network-use obligation attaching to every operator; revisit if the phase 4 dashboard is ever offered as a hosted service |
| 2026-08-08 | The licence text is fetched by `make license`, not committed as a copy | A transcribed licence that differs from the canonical text is worse than none |
| 2026-08-08 | No Postfix fork, no Windows-only build | A fork inherits the IPL/EPL licence and a process architecture that does not exist on Windows; dropping Linux would cost the CI and test platform for about a hundred lines of platform code |
